# miscellaneous traits which are helpful to obtain a biologically plausible model
# this also may include plausability checks of the predictions, as done here for S_max_rel (similar to pseudo-data)

age_at_birth:
    value: 2
    unit: d
    source: guess
egg_drymass:
    value: 5e-3
    unit: mg
    source: estimated from Martin-Creuzburg et al (2018) Figure 5 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00089)
S_max_rel:
    value: 1
    unit: none
    description: Compares the maximum strucutral mass reached by the end of the experimental period to the maximum structure implied by the parameters. The value is 1 since we expect the organism to approach it's maximum length by the end of the experimental period.
