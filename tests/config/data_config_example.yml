# example for a data config file
# data is divided into time-resolved and scalar
# the minimum information required for each entry is a name and path
# the basic structure is 
# time_resolved:
#   - name: 
#     path
#     time_var:
#     grouping_vars:
#        - [list column names of indepdendent variables here]
#     response_vars:
#        - [list column names of response variables here]
#     weight: 1 
#   ...
# scalar:
#   - name: 
#     path
#     independent_vars:
#        - [list column names of indepdendent variables here] --> can be empty for scalar data
#     response_vars:
#        - [list column names of response variables here]
#     weight: 1
#   ...
# paths are given relative to the project directory root

time_resolved:
  - name: growth_agg # always needed and has to be unique within the dataset

    time_var: t_birth # the column that indicates time in the data table
